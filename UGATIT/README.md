# U-GAT-IT

## Summary
- In addition to CycleGAN, the authors of this paper use Class Activation Map(CAM).
- As far as I watch the result of conversion described in paper, UGATIT can extract feaures better than CycleGAN.

## Usage

### Trainin Phase
Execute the command line below.

```bash
$ python train.py --src_path <SRC_PATH> --tgt_path <TGT_PATH>
```
`SRC_PATH` and `TGT_PATH` are direcotry which contains training images of each domain.

## Results
Result generated by my environment development is as follows.

- Batch size: 16
- Optimizer: Adam(α=0.0001, β1=0.5, β2=0.999)
- The weight of cycle-consistency loss, identity-mapping loss and CAM loss is 10.0, 10.0 and 1000.0
