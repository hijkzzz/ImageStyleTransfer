Haircolor translation black into white or white into black. Of course, you can translate into arbitrary haircolor if you prepare.  
Input size:128Ã—128

Haircolor translation into multi colors(ex : white -> black, blue, pink....).   
But, this code is not complete.  
Concretely. ar first, haircolor translation is done correctly. But if the number of epochs are increased,  generator comes to output raw image. Making improvements are needed.
