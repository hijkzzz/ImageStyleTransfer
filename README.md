Paper -> [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf "here")  

Haircolor translation black into white or white into black. Of course, you can translate into arbitrary haircolor if you prepare.  
Input size:128Ã—128

## StarGAN
Paper -> [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09020 "here")

Haircolor translation into multi colors(ex : white -> black, blue, pink....).   
Unlike in the paper above, I change InstanceNormalization of the generator into BatchNormalization.
